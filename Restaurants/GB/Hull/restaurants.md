Cerruttis Hull
Fish & Seafood Restaurant
One of the classiest and best seafood restaurants in the UK. Top notch food 
and service, good selection of wine's and spirits to accompany the meal.
Good views of the Humber river while you enjoy your meal. However, class 
comes at a price so consider a great place to eat for those rare special occasions.

Maharajah Restaurant
Indian & South Asian Restaurant
Spent many happy hours with friends consuming many of the delicious dishes on the menu.
Amazingly tasty but spicey food but even more amazing is how inexpensive a good meal is.
They don't sell alcohol but do not prevent you bringing your own beer and wine.

Traditional English Pub Grub
Good traditional atmosphere and a wide selection of tasty food. Good selection 
of beers and spirits to wash it down with. Excellent quality but not too pricy.
