# Nagy Levin Étterem (Restaurant Levin the Big)
## Hungarian
Very clean and friendly restaurant, food is great. Highly recommended!  
The style follows Jenõ Rejtõ's funny legionary books. Levin was a cook, a gourmand in one of the best of Rejtõ's books.  
The restaurant can be found in one of the less beautiful outer districts, but it worths to go there.
